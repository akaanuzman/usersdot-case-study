# Usersdot Case Study

## Overview

I am as happy as you are to have reached this stage :) I developed my case using Node.js with the NestJS framework for the back-end with a MySQL database, and React with Ant Design UI for the front-end. I believe I have met all the requirements specified in the case document. There might be some shortcomings, but I have tried to do my best within the given time. Thank you for your evaluations.

## Features

- **Feature/base branch structure**: Branch structure created for all features and enhancements and merged through pull requests
- **REST-API**: Create, update, delete, fetch users on Nestjs.
- **Documentation**: Documenting most parts with comment lines
- **Createful UI**: UI developed with user experience in mind.
